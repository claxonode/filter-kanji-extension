# Filter Kanji Firefox Extension

## What is it?
This a Firefox extension that makes navigating https://kanji.jitenon.jp/cat/ easier. This is probably the best site to learn more Kanji, if you can read a Japanese-to-Japanese dictionary.

## What can this extension do?
- You can filter out Kanji that you want to see, Jouyou, Jinmeiyou, Uncommons and also reset what is being displayed.

## Limitations
- It does not truly filter out kanji, rather it is a bit of Node manipulation via the class attribute, due to Jouyou Kanji's <li> and Jinmeiyou Kanji's <li> having classes that represent different colors
